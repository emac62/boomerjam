{% block appDescription %}

  <p>
    <b>My Tasks</b> is a simple To Do app.
</p>
  <p>Create tasks on one list with or without a due date. Each task has a notes section attached to store detailed
  information. Enabling notifications will allow a badge on the home icon to display the number of tasks due today or
  overdue.
</p>
  <p>Tasks are sorted and colour coded by due date. Overdue tasks appear in red, today's tasks are black, future tasks are
  dark grey and tasks without a due date are light grey.
</p>
  <p>
    <b>My Tasks</b> also has a widget called Today's Tasks that will only display the overdue and due todaytasks.
</p>
  <p>Click on the widget to open the app. Since the tasks are date dependant, we recommend you allow a 'Background App
  Refresh' in Settings. This will ensure the badge number on the icon is correct each morning.
